I help organizations run AI on their own terms — on their hardware, behind their firewall, under their control.

Most of my career has been in technical systems: embedded controllers, wireless telemetry, distributed architectures. Over the last decade, that work converged with containerized infrastructure and local LLM deployment. I enjoy solving the practical problems that come with running AI in resource-constrained, privacy-sensitive environments — the kind of work where things need to actually run reliably, not just demo well.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

### [AI-Powered Episcopal Bulletin Generation System](https://github.com/jhpritch-dev/church-ai-infrastructure)
7-container Docker Compose stack (Ollama, PostgreSQL, Redis, SurrealDB, Paperless-NGX, FastAPI, Flask) with 48GB managed memory and an offline-first 4-tier fallback system. Built to solve a real weekly workflow problem — automating document production that used to take hours of manual effort.

### [AI-Powered Choral Anthem Planning System (Choir Meta)](https://github.com/jhpritch-dev/choir-meta)
Three-tier architecture: SQLite with FTS5 full-text search, Express.js REST API, Electron desktop client. Includes an OCR pipeline for catalog digitization, fuzzy deduplication, and AI agent integration for recommendations.

### [Automated Photography Preset Generation System](https://github.com/jhpritch-dev/lightroom-preset-automation)
Python automation producing 49 Adobe XMP preset files from structured recipes. Template-driven generation pipeline with multi-tier commercial packaging — similar patterns to infrastructure-as-code workflows.

### AI Infrastructure Ops Assistant Agent *(In Development)*
Containerized monitoring agent using multiple local LLM runtimes (Ollama, LM Studio, AMD AI Suite) for infrastructure health monitoring, natural language querying, and anomaly detection across a production Docker environment.

### Private Cloud Platform & Zero-Trust Infrastructure
Dual-CPU server running Docker microservices (OwnCloud, Immich/Photoprism, Ollama, Home Assistant, automated backups) on 10TB software-defined storage with SSD caching. Zero-trust networking via Tailscale/WireGuard mesh VPN, VLAN segmentation, 2.5GbE switching. Running 3+ years with zero data loss.

## 📐 How I Got Here

My background is unconventional. I hold a doctorate from the University of South Carolina, where my research involved designing wireless telemetry systems and ad hoc WiFi networks for real-time data collection. I've spent 30+ years maintaining CPU-driven embedded control systems — low-voltage wiring, relay logic, microprocessor switching — the kind of work where you learn to troubleshoot methodically because the system won't tell you what's wrong.

About a decade ago I started building home infrastructure out of genuine need: containerized services, software-defined storage, zero-trust networking. When local LLM deployment became practical, the pieces came together naturally. The infrastructure experience, the systems thinking, the preference for solutions you can maintain yourself — it all pointed in the same direction.

I've learned more from things that didn't work the first time than from things that did. That tends to happen when you're building real systems for actual use, not just proofs of concept.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

Remote AI Infrastructure, DevOps, or Platform Engineering roles where I can contribute to teams deploying AI capabilities thoughtfully — self-hosted, privacy-aware, and built to last.

I'm at my best when I can dig into a problem, build something that works, document it clearly, and hand it off so others can maintain it. If that sounds useful to your team, I'd welcome the conversation.

*I believe good infrastructure should be owned, not rented.*
